# Striver SDE Sheet Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Striver SDE Sheet problems, implemented in both C++ and Python.

## About

The Striver SDE Sheet is a curated list of important Data Structures and Algorithms problems frequently asked in technical interviews at top tech companies. This repository serves as my personal practice and reference for interview preparation.

## Structure

Each problem is named with a number prefix followed by the problem name:
- `XXX_ProblemName.cpp` - C++ solution
- `XXX_ProblemName.py` - Python solution

## Topics Covered

- Arrays and Matrices
- Linked Lists
- Greedy Algorithms
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Binary Search
- Stacks and Queues
- Strings
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Tries
- Heaps

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ADiTyaRaj8969/Striver-SDE-Sheet.git
   ```

2. Navigate to any solution file to view the implementation.

3. To run a C++ solution:
   ```
   g++ XXX_ProblemName.cpp -o solution
   ./solution
   ```

4. To run a Python solution:
   ```
   python XXX_ProblemName.py
   ```
